# An Evening with... EM

Interactive tutorial on the Forward-Backward Expectation Maximization algorithm. You will need iPython with Python 3 running on your machine. 

To run the notebook, open a terminal window, move to the directory where you downloaded the files, and start iPython, like so:
```
cd emtutorial
ipyhon notebook
```

Have fun, and feel free to leave feedback!
